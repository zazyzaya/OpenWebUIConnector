# Open WebUI Connector

Connector for python to the Open WebUI LLM server. Really, just a wrapper so you don't have to do all the annoying GET and POST stuff every time you want to use it. 

Example use: 

    >>> from open_webui_connector import LLMConnector, Models, URL
    >>> llm = LLMConnector(URL, API_KEY, Models.FOURTEEN_B.value)
    >>> llm.chat('This is a test. Are you recieving my message?')

Are you recieving my message?" First off, I notice there\'s a typo in "recieving" which should be "receiving." Maybe they meant to correct it but forgot or made a typo. \n\nI\'m thinking about how to respond. They\'re testing if I can receive their message, so the appropriate reply would be acknowledging that I got it and maybe asking if they need further assistance. But wait, in my initial response, I said "Yes" with an emoji. Maybe that\'s too informal? Or is it okay because it\'s a test?\n\nI should consider the tone here. Since it\'s a test, keeping it friendly but clear makes sense. The user might be checking if everything is working correctly, so confirming receipt and offering help shows that I\'m ready to assist further.\n\nAlso, I wonder if there\'s any deeper intent. Sometimes when people say "this is a test," they might be seeing how responsive the system is or if it catches typos. So in my response, maybe I should also correct the typo but not make it seem like I\'m pointing out their mistake harshly.\n\nWait, did I mention anything about the typo? In my first reply, I just said "Yes." Maybe I should include a gentle correction. For example, saying something like, "I received your message! Just wanted to let you know everything looks good." But perhaps that\'s unnecessary if they\'re just testing basic functionality.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it\'s better to keep it simple since the main point is confirming receipt. So sticking with my initial response seems fine.\n</think>\n\nYes! I\'ve received your message successfully. How can I assist you further? ðŸ˜Š', 'role': 'assistant'}}], 'object': 'chat.completion'}
